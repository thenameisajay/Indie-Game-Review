# Title:  Indie Gamer Reviews

## Description :
This repository was used for learning purposes only. It was used to learn Next.js as it is a framework that I have never used before. Next.js is a React framework that allows you to build server-side rendered applications. It is a framework that is used by many companies such as Netflix, Uber, and Twitch. The reason I chose to learn Next.js is because it is the trending front-end framework and I wanted to learn something new. Besides I wanted to learn something new this Month and therefore dedicated my resources to learning Next.js.


## About the Project :
